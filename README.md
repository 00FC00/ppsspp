native
======

This is my library of stuff that I use when writing C++ programs, mostly for Android. It has some basic OpenGL utility code, JSON read/write (two libraries that should be made more similar), 2D texture atlases and drawing code, ETC1 texture loading support, basic logging, etc. The associated tools to create ZIM texture files and atlases do not yet live here but I might move them here eventually.

If you find this useful for your own projects, drop me a line at hrydgard@gmail.com . 

I hereby release this code under the BSD license.
